            <h3>The GlucoGuard with slogan.</h3>
            <p>Diabetes type 2 has become a pressing concern in our society, emerging as one of the most prevalent
                health
                issues. Particularly affecting individuals with lower socioeconomic status (SES) in our society.The
                severity
                of this condition goes beyond individual health, significantly straining healthcare systems and
                impacting
                overall societal well-being. Unhealthy lifestyle choices, limited access to healthy options, and
                economic
                hardships contribute to the alarming rise in diabetes type 2 cases. Urgent efforts are required to
                address
                this epidemic, promoting healthier living and financial feasibility for individuals to adopt healthier
                lifestyles. Yet, initiating this positive change starts with a minor adjustment, and that's where the
                GlucoGuard comes into play.</p>


            <p>For this project, I have engaged in a collaboration with Deloitte and LIME (Limburg Meet), aiming to find
                a
                solution for the escalating pressure in healthcare through an innovative concept. LIME is assisting me
                in
                the technical aspects of the project by involving students from the medical field to provide insights
                and
                conduct health tests. During a test day in Roermond, I was allowed to interview pedestrians to gather
                feedback on the project.

            <p>The objective was initially broad, prompting my decision to refine it. It was swiftly determined that the
                project's focus would center on type 2 diabetes. Statistics indicate that 1 in 3 Dutch individuals aged
                45
                and above will develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime, leading to associated conditions like
                cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, many individuals in my immediate circle are living with this
                condition.
            </p>
            <p>Once individuals progress beyond the pre-diabetes stage, it becomes irreversible. Consequently, my goal
                is to
                "heighten awareness about the pre-diabetes phase and provide effective support."</p>

            <p>Current technology still faces challenges in non-invasively measuring blood glucose. Initially, I
                proposed a
                self-pricking station in supermarkets, allowing customers to perform a finger prick. However, after
                testing,
                it became evident that customers were reluctant due to needle aversion, hygienic, and privacy concerns.
            </p>

            <p>After extensive research, I discovered the German company DiaMonTech, actively developing the D-Pocket.
                This
                small device measures blood glucose levels using light, eliminating the need for needles. It is
                anticipated
                that this product will be available in the market within a few years.</p>

            <p>Building upon this technology, I conceptualized GlucoGuard—an app extension functioning as an overlay on
                existing applications like the AH app. GlucoGuard will also integrate with other supermarket-connected
                apps.
                For this project, we assume the utilization of the AH app.</p>


            <p>The GlucoGuard is a companion that assists you in making informed decisions at the supermarket regarding
                sugar intake. It alerts you with a bark when you scan a product high in sugar content and recommends a
                substitute with lower sugar, if needed. If a product is already low in sugars, a green label will be
                displayed next to it. The app also features recipes marked with this label. On your profile, you can
                track
                how much sugar and money you've saved with each purchase.</p>
            <p>Beyond offering advice, GlucoGuard helps you take measurements in the supermarket. This process occurs in
                a
                small booth near a screened pole at the information desk. A service worker can assist you with a simple
                button press if the measurement proves challenging. To take the measurement, scan your loyalty card and
                follow the steps on the screen. Later, you can view or print your results at the pole through the
                application.</p>

            <p>The prototype of the GlucoGuard overlay extension is available in the Figma file below. It's designed at
                a
                high-fidelity level and adopts the visual identity of the AH (Albert Heijn) application. If used in
                other
                supermarket applications, the GlucoGuard extension adapts to their respective visual identities while
                maintaining the same functionality. Please refer to the Figma file for detailed explanations and
                functionality.</p>
