            <h1>Exploration of the 3D World</h1>
            <p>This is a small collection of works, some of which are still in progress, that showcase my journey into
                the realm of 3D software. On this page, featured programs I delved into include Adobe Aero, Blender,
                Unreal Engine, and Three.js.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Adobe Aero</h2>
            <p>For a museum, I designed an AR experience with a prehistoric theme. In this design, you can observe
                cavemen living their daily lives and performing tasks. The tribe's leader welcomes you and guides you
                around the village. Using the museum-provided tablet, you can interact with the cavemen by clicking on
                them, triggering dialogue. Throughout this project, I learned how to rig humanoid creatures in Blender
                for posing and discovered the suitable objects for import into Adobe Aero. Additionally, I focused on
                designing the layout of the village.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Blender</h2>
            <h4>Blender portal</h4>
            <p>My school provided me with the opportunity to learn Blender as a subject. After a brief crash course that
                only scratched the surface, I recently revisited Blender. One of my ongoing projects, "The Portal,"
                involves learning UV-unwrapping for scenes and planning to add animations. I gained insights into basic
                functionality, lighting, and scene building using self-made assets.

        <h4>Blender Animation</h4>
        <p>My final project for the Blender course features a sphere in the center (core) with objects orbiting it.
            I utilized geometry nodes in Blender to make cubes move around the core. This project also involved
            learning how to move the camera within the scene.

        <p>Beneath this text, you can find some other (unfinished) works. I experimented with basic functionality to
            get a feel for Blender as a program.</p>

        <h2>Exploring Unreal Engine</h2>
        <h4>MUMC Hackathon</h4>
        <p>In 2023, my school participated in the MUMC Hackathon at Maastricht UMC. Our task was to raise awareness
            about the challenges non-electrical wheelchair users face at night. I created scenes illustrating this
            problem, incorporating online assets, lighting adjustments, and scanning my own asset (the wheelchair
            user) using Polycam 3D. This project taught me positioning, quick asset discovery, scanning usable
            assets with a phone, adjusting light sources, and effective camera work.</p>

        <h4>The Back Rooms with a Twist</h4>
        <p>Are liminal spaces familiar to you? Or perhaps you have glitched out of reality yourself and found
            yourself in a strange place? That's the backrooms for you. Over 10 weeks at school, I focused on Unreal
            Engine, creating my version of the backrooms (still in progress). This exploration involved delving into
            liminal spaces and understanding AI in gaming. I built patrolling and hunting AI characters, delving
            into blueprints, materials, lighting, and basic functionality. Creating patrolling and hunting AI’s for
            my project was no easy feat. However, it was really rewarding when I managed to figure it out partly.
            The backrooms have greatly interested me for a long time, as do liminal spaces. I don't really
            understand why, but I feel pulled towards them in a sense.

        <h2>Exploring Three.js</h2>
        <p>Where are the finished projects? It's a fair question. While the course hasn't yet yielded a polished
            portfolio, what you see here is a testament to the skills gained throughout this journey. The absence of
            a traditional portfolio underscores the raw, unfiltered nature of my learning process – a work in
            progress in itself. </p>

        <p>
            As you navigate this portfolio website, every line of code, design choice, and interactive element is a
            result of my Three.js exploration. It's a showcase of evolving skills, incorporating not just final
            products but the process and learning gathered along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey goes beyond mastering a library; it's about discovery, experimentation, and embracing the
            iterative nature of creation. Challenges are opportunities to learn, iterate, and improve – a philosophy
            reflected in the structure of this portfolio. Moving forward, as I refine my understanding of Three.js,
            the goal is not just to fill a portfolio but to cultivate a deep, intuitive grasp of 3D graphics for
            crafting immersive, innovative experiences. Welcome to my ongoing Three.js journey – stay tuned for
            exciting projects soon to be showcased here!
