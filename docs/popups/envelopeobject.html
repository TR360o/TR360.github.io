        <h2>Embark on a design journey into Limburg's social history, where our team revitalized archives through a
            vibrant history festival. Focused on pivotal events like the Buckriders, coal mines, and WWII, our concept
            humanizes history through the lens of letters.

        <p>I participated in a graphic design and user experience project for the Social History Center Limburg (SHCL)
            situated in the province of Limburg, The Netherlands. Despite housing an extensive collection of archives
            and records chronicling the social history of the region, this historical wealth has not garnered
            substantial recognition. Within our team of three, my role was to help come up with concepts for the project
            as well as developing a design aimed at rekindling interest in Limburg's history, ultimately seeking to
            secure increased support for the SHCL.

        <p>We were presented with the challenge of creating a history festival centered around Maastricht and other
            regions of the Limburg province. After careful consideration, it was decided not to narrow our focus to a
            specific part of Limburg's history but rather to spotlight significant events throughout its historical
            timeline. Three pivotal points in time were chosen to be the central focus of the festival: the Buckriders
            (de Bokkenrijders), the coal mines, and the Second World War. The common thread connecting these events is
            letters.</p>
        <p>Letters, serving as a means of communication from loved ones to family and friends, held immense significance
            for many people. Individuals poured their hearts into these letters, sharing a myriad of stories. Our
            concept aims to transport you back in time through the letters that have documented history. By using these
            letters, we seek to humanize and make these historical events more tangible, providing a unique perspective
            on the Buckriders, the coal mines, and the Second World War.

        <p>Each historical point in time was assigned a color, and an icon was created to represent the event. To
            contrast the weighty topics at hand, it was decided to employ a light and bright color palette. Despite the
            serious nature of the topics, the festival's design couldn't be too gloomy and should remain accessible for
            people of all ages. Festival postcards, postage stamps, stickers, and buttons were designed with the idea
            that visitors could write and send letters to their loved ones, sharing stories.
